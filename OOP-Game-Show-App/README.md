# OOP Game Show App
Phrase Hunter:
 A browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) was used in order to create this game. The game selects at random a hidden phrase, which you must try to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard or your physical keyboard.

Rules: 
Each time you guess a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen.

You will continue to select letters until you guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

If the you complete the phrase before you run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the you guess incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.

You can guess a letter only once. After you've guessed a letter, that letter will be disabled on the onscreen keyboard.
